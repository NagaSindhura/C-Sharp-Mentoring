It should be one solution with several projects inside. Set console application as startup app, demonstrate the results of both tasks in the main.

and because of memory consumption limitations by the application you can not copy it to the cache. 
Provide the best way to preserve the initial state of the application if an error occurred during the data transfer. 
Write an example of this processing
